Creation & Object Ownership
-------------

The main envire class is envire::Environment. It holds all the elements of the
environment and stores them in the different structures. In general, all
elements that are stored in an an environment are derived from
envire::EnvironmentItem. Object ownership of EnvironmentItem is shared through
the used of boost::intrusive_ptr reference counting. Holding such a pointer is
simplified through the use of the ::Ptr typedef, which is available in all
classes derived from EnvironmentItem. Creating and attaching an EnvironmentItem
works like this

{coderay:: cpp}
#include <envire/Core.hpp>
using namespace envire;

...

// create an Environment on the stack
Environment env;

// EnvironmentItem objects (such as FrameNode)
// need to be created on the heap. 
// The FrameNode::Ptr type performs the reference
// counting for shared ownership
FrameNode::Ptr frame = new FrameNode;

// This will make the frame known to the environment
env.attachItem( frame );

Structure
--------------

As mentioned in the overview page, there are four different types of objects
that the environment does distinguish. FrameNode, CartesianMap, Layer and
Operator.  Each of these objects has a different structure that the environment
stores.

 - The FrameNodes are organized in a tree structure. Any environment always has
   at least one FrameNode, which is the root FrameNode. This one can be
   considered the world origin reference frame. All FrameNodes that are added to
   the environment need to be attached to a parent node, so that operations
   relating it to other frames are valid. Further, each CartesianMap can be
   assigned to be associated with one FrameNode. 

 - The LayerTree provides structure within maps. Like the FrameNode structure
   this is a tree. However, there is no single tree root, so multiple trees are
   allowed here. A root node is a Layer that does not have a parent. This structure
   is used to store relationships within maps, e.g. level of detail or other types
   of hierarchical maps.

- The OperatorGraph is a structure that links operators to layers. Each operator
  can have multiple inputs and outputs. Operators work through dirty handling of
  maps. So that for a certain input map, if the map is flagged as modified, the
  operator can decide if and what of the output needs to be updated. This is
  useful in situations, where the structure of the environment changes, and this
  has implications on derived information.

The OperatorGraph functionality is currently not fully implemented. The
structure for holding is there, but no automatic chaining of dirty operations or
partial updates is implemented, yet. 
{: .warning}

The Environment provides a number of operations to modify the listed structures.
All operations where it makes sense also have the feature, that they will
automatically attach an item to the environemnt if this has not yet happened.

The following is an example which is taken from the test/unit/core.hpp
unit tests and the resulting structure visualised with the GraphViz file
generation class.

{coderay:: cpp}
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( environment )
{
    // set up an environment
    boost::scoped_ptr<Environment> env( new Environment() );

    // an environment should always have a root node 
    BOOST_CHECK( env->getRootNode() );

    // create some child framenodes
    FrameNode *fn1, *fn2, *fn3;
    fn1 = new FrameNode();
    fn1->setTransform( 
	    Eigen::Affine3d(
		Eigen::Translation3d( 0.0, 0.0, 0.5 )) );
    fn2 = new FrameNode();
    fn2->setTransform( 
	    Eigen::Affine3d(
		Eigen::Quaterniond(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 )));
    fn3 = new FrameNode();
    fn3->setTransform( 
	    Eigen::Affine3d(
		Eigen::Translation3d(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)));
    
    // attach explicitely
    env->attachItem( fn1 );
    env->addChild( env->getRootNode(), fn1 );

    // implicit attachment
    env->addChild( fn1, fn2 );
    
    // setup the rest of the framenodes
    env->addChild( env->getRootNode(), fn3 );    

    // perform a relative transformation
    FrameNode::TransformType rt1 = 
	env->relativeTransform(fn2, fn1);

    FrameNode::TransformType rt2 = 
	env->relativeTransform(fn2, fn3);
    
    // now do the same for layers
    Layer *l1, *l2, *l3;
    l1 = new DummyLayer();
    l2 = new DummyLayer();
    l3 = new DummyLayer();

    env->attachItem( l1 );
    env->addChild( l1, l2 );
    env->attachItem(l3);

    // CartesianMaps should work the same
    CartesianMap *m1, *m2;
    m1 = new DummyCartesianMap();
    m2 = new DummyCartesianMap();

    env->attachItem( m1 );
    env->attachItem( m2 );

    env->setFrameNode( m1, fn1 );
    env->setFrameNode( m2, fn1 );

    // now to operators
    Operator *o1;
    o1 = new DummyOperator();
    env->attachItem( o1 );

    env->addInput( o1, m1 );
    env->addInput( o1, m2 );
    env->addOutput( o1, l2 );

    GraphViz gv;
    gv.writeToFile( env.get(), "build/test/env.dot" );
}
