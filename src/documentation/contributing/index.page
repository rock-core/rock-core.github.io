There are multiple ways to contribute to Rock

First and foremost, you can [report bugs](bugreports.html) on the Trac
interface, send comments and suggest enhancements (both positive and negative
ones) to the
[orocos-users](http://lists.mech.kuleuven.be/mailman/listinfo/orocos-users)
and/or [rock-dev](http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-dev) mailing
lists.

One thing that is always in need of contribution is documentation: create new
pages [on the Rock trac](http://rock.opendfki.de) or [update the Rock reference
documentation](documentation.html) on the Rock website.

More advanced users can contribute bugfixes and enhancements to the main Rock
codebase, by either sending patches to the rock-dev mailing list or using
gitorious cloning and merge request functionality. We also welcome you to
[publish packages and tell us about them](packages.html) so that they become
part of the Rock package directory.
