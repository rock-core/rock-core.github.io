While the previous tutorials refer to the example "rock controlled by a 
joystick", we will now have a look at how to set up an actual robot.

The following topics will be addressed by this tutorial, in the order in which
the steps are normally carried out when a new robot is set up:

* Create and configure a new build system and add it to git version control
* Create and configure the corresponding bundle
* Configure the transformer
* Create scripts for the robot
* Integration into MARS

Create the build system
-----------------------

To create a new build system, it is best to start with an existing one and to
adapt it according to your needs. Bootstrapping is explained 
[here](http://rock-robotics.org/master/documentation/autoproj/bootstrap.html). 
As an example, _rock/buildconf_ is a basic Rock configuration.

Add the build system to git version control
-------------------------------------

Pick a git hosting method and create a new project, containing two repositories.
One of them should be named _buildconf.git_ - it is for your the main autoproj 
configuration. The other one should be named _package_set.git_ - it is for your
package set. Push your build system's current _autoproj_ folder to 
_buildconf.git_ on git.

In the main folder of your new build system (_acd your_project_name_), do:

~~~
autoproj switch-config git@your_git_hosting_method:your_project_name/buildconf.git
~~~

To add the package set to git version control, first create an empty 
_package_set_ folder. Create a _source.yml_ file and edit the first line as 
follows:

~~~
name: your project name
~~~

Then do:

~~~
git init
touch libs.autobuild
touch orogen.autobuild
touch deps.osdeps
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push git@your_git_hosting_method:your_project_name/package_set.git HEAD:master
~~~

Choose the packages you need for your bundle from [the package directory]
(http://rock-robotics.org/master/package_directory.html) and update the 
_autoproj/manifest_ file accordingly.

Bundles in Rock
---------------

Bundles in Rock are needed to run (sub)systems. 

In practice, bundles are Rock packages and they - most importantly - contain
the following:

 * ruby scripts (to run sets of components) - contained in the _scripts/_ folder
 * configuration files for oroGen tasks - contained in the _config/orogen/_ folder
 * log files - contained in the _logs/_ folder
 * ...

See [the wiki](http://rock.opendfki.de/wiki/WikiStart/Standards/RG7) for more
information on bundles.

Create the bundle
----------------- 

~~~
rock-create-bundle desired/path/to/my/bundle
~~~

The name of your bundle should, for logical reasons, equal the name of your 
robot. It should be located in a _bundles_ folder in your Rock installation.

Configure the bundle
--------------------

_rock-inspect_ can help you to find existing tasks you might want to include
in your bundle. For example, try _rock_inspect -t camera_ to get a list of
all available tasks associated with "camera".

The tasks you include into your bundle are configured using a YAML file. 
To create a new configuration file, do:

~~~
oroconf extract taskname::Task --save=config/orogen/
~~~

The new template file is generated in the config/orogen subfolder of the bundle, 
with a file name that matches the oroGen model name (here, 
_config/orogen/taskname::Task.yml_)

Configure the transformer
-------------------------

When data is processed by your robotic system, there will usually be quite a
number of transformations between different frames, e.g. between a laser scanner
and the body-center of the robot. Rock's transformer handles the processing of
geometrical information, so that in each component, only the needed 
transformations have to be specified, while transformations specified in other
components are made available during runtime.

Inside the bundle, the transformer file is located in _config/transforms.rb_.

Static transformations are declared as follows:

~~~ ruby
static_transform translation, rotation,
  "source_frame_name" => "target_frame_name"
~~~

Translation and rotations are resp. specified with Eigen::Vector3d and
Eigen::Quaternion. The very useful Eigen::Quaternion.from_axis(angle, axis) call
is often used in these files. The translation or rotation can be omitted if they
are identities.

Dynamic transformations are declared as follows:

~~~ ruby
dynamic_transform "producer_task_name.port_name",
  "source_frame_name" => "target_frame_name",
~~~

Where _producer_task_name_ and _port_name_ refer to the data stream that defines
the required transformation. If the task has only one RigidBodyState output
port, the port name can be left empty. 

As you can see, the _transforms.rb_ file contains the global information about 
which transformation is specified in which task. Look 
[here](http://rock-robotics.org/master/documentation/data_processing/transformer_orogen.html)
for more information about how transformations are specified in oroGen 
components.
