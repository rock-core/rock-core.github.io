title: Adding the build system to git version control
sort_info: 200
---

Pick a git hosting method and create a new project, containing two repositories.
One of them should be named _buildconf.git_ - it is for your the main autoproj
configuration. The other one should be named _package_set.git_ - it is for your
package set. Push your build system's current _autoproj_ folder to
_buildconf.git_ on git.

In the main folder of your new build system (_acd your_project_name_), do:

~~~
autoproj switch-config git@your_git_hosting_method:your_project_name/buildconf.git
~~~

To add the package set to git version control, first create an empty
_package_set_ folder. Create a _source.yml_ file and edit the first line as
follows:

~~~
name: your project name
~~~

Then do:

~~~
git init
touch libs.autobuild
touch orogen.autobuild
touch deps.osdeps
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push git@your_git_hosting_method:your_project_name/package_set.git HEAD:master
~~~

Choose the packages you need for your bundle from [the package directory]
(http://rock-robotics.org/master/package_directory.html) and update the
_autoproj/manifest_ file accordingly. For more information about how to install
packages, have a look [here](../tutorials/190_installing_packages.html).

In short, the desired packages need to be added to the _layout_ section of your
_autoproj/manifest_ file, for example - for a Hokuyo laser scanner:

~~~
layout:
  - drivers/hokuyo
~~~

Make sure that the corresponding package set is also declared in your
_autoproj/manifest_ file. For the a.-m. example, it is:

~~~
package_sets:
  - gitorious: rock/package_set
~~~

Call _amake_ to install the declared packages.
