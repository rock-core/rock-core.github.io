While the previous tutorials refer to the example "rock controlled by a
joystick", we will now have a look at how to set up an actual robot.

The following topics will be addressed by this tutorial, in the order in which
the steps are normally carried out when a new robot is set up:

* Set up a new build system and add it to git version control
* Create the corresponding bundle as well as configuration files for tasks
* Configure the transformer
* Create scripts for the robot
* Integration into MARS
