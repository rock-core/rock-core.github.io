title: Add build system to git
sort_info: 200
---

Pick a git hosting method and create a new project, containing two
repositories.  One of them is usually named _buildconf.git_ - it is for your
the main autoproj configuration. The other one should be named
_package_set.git_ - it describes the software collection of packages used in
your project. Push your build system's current _autoproj_ folder to
_buildconf.git_ on your git hoster.

To get a feeling have a look at `rock-core`s
[buildconf](https://github.com/rock-core/buildconf) and a
[rock-package_set](https://github.com/rock-core/rock-package_set)

In the main folder of your new build system (_acd your_project_name_), do:

~~~
autoproj switch-config git@your_git_hoster:your_project/buildconf.git
~~~

To add the package set to git version control, first create an empty
_package_set_ folder. Create a _source.yml_ file and edit the first line as
follows:

~~~
name: your project name
~~~

Then do:

~~~
git init
touch libs.autobuild
touch orogen.autobuild
touch deps.osdeps
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push git@your_git_hoster:your_project/package_set.git HEAD:master
~~~

Choose the packages you need for your bundle from [the package
directory](../../package_directory.html) and update the _autoproj/manifest_
file accordingly. For more information about how to install packages, have a
look [here](../tutorials/190_installing_packages.html).

In short, the desired packages need to be added to the _layout_ section of your
_autoproj/manifest_ file, for example - for a Hokuyo laser scanner:

~~~
layout:
  - drivers/hokuyo
~~~

Make sure that the corresponding package set is also declared in your
_autoproj/manifest_ file. For the a.-m. example, it is:

~~~
package_sets:
  - github: rock-core/package_set
~~~

Call _aup --all_ to install the declared packages.
