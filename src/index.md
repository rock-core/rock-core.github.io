<p>Rock offers both a <strong>rich development environment</strong> and a collection of
<strong>ready-to-use packages</strong>. This documentation pages describe the development
environment as well as some important &ldquo;core&rdquo; libraries. For the package
documentation, go to the <a href="/pkg">package list</a></p>

<p>First and foremost, development in Rock always starts with <strong><a href="tutorials/100_basics_create_library.html">creating a
library</a></strong>. As a guideline, this
library has to be independent of Rock&rsquo;s component-based integration framework.
That&rsquo;s right, even if you don&rsquo;t use Rock&rsquo;s tooling, <a href="packages/outside_of_rock.html">feel free to use its
drivers and algorithms</a> Then, this library gets
integrated in <strong>oroGen</strong>, Rock&rsquo;s component-oriented integration framework.</p>

<p>For runtime, network of Rock components are often setup and managed using <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">the
Ruby programming language</a>. Bindings to Ruby allow to start
processes, start and stop components, connect them together and bind them to
user interfaces in a very flexible way.</p>

<p><a href="tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a> will guide you through getting to grips with
the process, from a library to running network of components.</p>

<h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2>

<p>At this point, Rock offers extended support for runtime as well as offline data
analysis. <a href="data_analysis/index.html">Logging</a> is an integral part of the
development workflow: it can be used for post-mortem analysis as well as to
test components through log replay mechanisms. Then, <strong>Vizkit</strong> kicks in. is
both an oroGen-independent library of Qt-based widgets and OpenSceneGraph-based
3D visualizers, and a Ruby library that allows to seamlessly display both
logged and live data. Extending it with new widgets and visualizers is
straightforward.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-system-management">Advanced System Management</h2>
<p>Finally, Rock gives you rock-roby, a <a href="system/index.html">model-based system management
layer</a> which will allow you to manage complex networks of
components both at design and running time. Have a look first at the
<a href="system_management_tutorials/">corresponding tutorials</a>.</p>
